I"ve been striving in the programming world for more than 5 years now and <br> I have spent 3 of these years before the existence of a lot of AI tools <br> that modern programmers - or shall I say "Vibe coders" - rely on.
<br><br>
ChatGPT,  Claude,  Perplexity (the only good AI) and a lot of the many tools <br> that has only appeared recently were merely a luxury at my time, All you had  <br> to solve issues were platforms like GitHub,  StackOverflow,  Reddit and <br> the thousand forums there is for every piece of software.
<br><br>
You had to ACTUALLY make use of your brain in order to piece answers together from multiple sources and <br> form your own understanding of a *probable* solution that might as well fail to work,  In which case you either <br> went insane or took on another battle to find a fix.
<br><br>
To clarify,  I'm not against using AI in a productive manner,  I personally use a couple of AI tools <br> daily in order to make my life easier and also avoid doing tedious tasks that technology can <br> do tirelessly,  Quickly,  And much effectively then I'll probably be able to do.
<br><br>
What I will complain about however is the unexplainable number of beginner programmers <br> that think,  actually not think, BELIEVE that AI will take over this industry sooner or later <br> Which is not only wrong but also an absurdly popular belief that makes me question <br> whether certain people should've picked up CS as a major or not.
<br><br>
I help out in multiple communities in my free time,  And countless times I had this <br> beginner (maybe first year CS major) ask a question along the lines of <br> "Will AI take over this industry?" or "I'm scared to learn coding because AI, what do I do?"<br> And each damn time I have to explain how AI is only a tool and that it can't <br> understand code.
<br><br>
It has gotten tiring over time to explain this to every single person and to <br> counter the many repetitive arguments they use,  Not to mention <br> that almost all of these arguments are coming either from YouTube or <br> some random irrational blog post on the internet that can't be taken <br> seriously.
