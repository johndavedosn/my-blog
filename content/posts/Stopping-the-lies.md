IT is such a vast and massive domain, A domain in which resides a lot of fields of knowledge and <br> specialties that one can dive into, From Cyber Security to web development and <br> my personal favourite; low level development. <br> <br>
In order to keep yourself updated and a little bit knowledgable in most fields you'd have to follow a somewhat <br> strict and interesting flow of continous,  lifelong learning, Whether you use YouTube or the documentation <br> There's always going to be some external source than you get your information from, Most of these sources are <br> not made by passion and instead are commercial sources who's goal in the end is  to get that <br> sweet sweet green paper out of your pocket and into their pockets <br> <br>
I'm not exactly against trying to earn by spreading knowledge, it is a widely accepted source of income that all parties benefit from <br> Though I am against the practices some of these providers follow in order to achieve their end goal,  Of which I'm discussing today is lying. <br> <br>
Some course providers,  In their infinite wisdom and sacred knowledge Decide to spread lies and misinformation <br> in order to make their courses more appealable and interesting,  Most of these lies are just catch phrases <br> and fancy slogans to get you to pay for their services, I'm gonna go through and bust some. <br> <br>

## 1. Programming is easy.
<br><br> Well,   I honestly don't know in which world whoever says that lives in but it is simply not true <br> Programming is simple and not easy, What is the difference you say? Programming concepts <br>
tend to be easy to understand in theory (simple),  but hard to apply in practice (not easy). <br> <br>

## 2. Everyone should learn how to code.
<br><br> Alright Dave,  Let me tell my farmer uncle to get a computer and learn Python! <br>
Seriously though,  Programming is as any field,  Something you learn by your <br> pure will, There's certainly people who's programming isn't for and who <br> simply will not like it,  If humans didn't differ,  The merch won't be sold. <br> <br>

## 3. You'll learn programming in X amount of time.
<br><br> No shit sherlock,  You're telling me I will learn how to code in 24 hours? <br> You see,  my reader friend,  Learning is not supposed to be fast,  it's slow and painful, <br> 
You need to go through all possible mistakes in order to know how to solve them <br> And doing this isn't fast at all.<br><br>

## 4. This course guarantees a six-figure salary.

<br><br> If your course didn't provide me the salary promised,  I'll make **you** pay it <br> Your salary most definitely depends on how much skill and expertise <br> you have and how well you did negotiating the salary.<br><br>

## 5. Our course follows a unique, proven methodology.

<br><br> Well,   As far as I am aware,  explaining concepts and their practical applications in <br> simple none-technical terms is a proven working methodogy <br> So there no need to re-invent the wheel in this case.
